Corruption, backslapping.

168
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:24,732
But today, maybe some
good will come of it.

169
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,727
I went to grammar school with this boy

170
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:28,396
named Ibrahim.

171
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,074
All the years later,
he's a federal judge.

172
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:33,810
You, uh, saying this judge can help us?

173
00:07:33,813 --> 00:07:35,579
I called him a few
hours ago and told him

174
00:07:35,615 --> 00:07:36,981
about your brother's case.

175
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:39,881
- [gunshot in the distance]

176
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:42,453
JAMIL: Redecorating, I see.

177
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:45,789
Just readying for the
coming change of seasons.

178
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:49,560
Luxury is something the
Wahabbists frown upon,

179
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:51,795
so luxury will stay behind closed doors.

180
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:53,579
You should flee the country.

181
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:54,998
I'm a survivor, you know that.

182
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:56,934
I thought Mr. Burrows could perhaps

183
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,469
help with his brother's cause.

184
00:07:58,505 --> 00:08:01,138
Ah, yes.

185
00:08:01,174 --> 00:08:05,876
A full pardon from the
Supreme Judicial Council.

186
00:08:05,912 --> 00:08:08,445
But you will have to uphold
your end of the bargain,

187
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:10,615
Jamil.

188
00:08:12,496 --> 00:08:15,986
German engineering. 77,000 miles.

189
00:08:16,022 --> 00:08:17,938
Five liter, seven speed, V10.

190
00:08:17,941 --> 00:08:20,624
It will be a welcome bit of luxury.

191
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,294
Behind closed doors, of course.

192
00:08:23,297 --> 00:08:26,230
Best of luck to both of you.

193
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:27,498
I really appreciate this.

194
00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:28,866
- Thank you.
- [car door closes]

195
00:08:28,902 --> 00:08:30,968
It's already done.

196
00:08:31,004 --> 00:08:35,706
It would've been left behind anyhow.

197
00:08:37,553 --> 00:08:38,888
May both of our families

198
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:41,311
get safely out of Sana'a tonight.

199
00:08:41,347 --> 00:08:43,313
[explosion]

200
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:45,245
WHIP: We can't just sit here and die.

201
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:47,651
You-you got a window
like this one, right?

202
00:08:47,687 --> 00:08:49,044
Maybe we can pry it.

203
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:50,854
It's too small, reinforced.

204
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,614
Built into the rebar infrastructure.

205
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:54,169
You got people on the outside, right?

206
00:08:54,172 --> 00:08:55,660
And they're gonna try and get us out.

207
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:56,994
They were supposed
to meet us at the shop

208
00:08:56,996 --> 00:08:58,328
last night and we didn't show.

209
00:08:58,364 --> 00:08:59,496
We can't just quit

210
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:01,798
- and let Poseidon beat us.
- Ramal?

211
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:04,101
There's a way out if we work together,

212
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:06,203
but escape has to start from your cell.

213
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:08,239
I'm no longer interested.

214
00:09:08,741 --> 00:09:11,904
The only thing left
for you to do is to beg.

215
00:09:11,907 --> 00:09:14,845
Beg that I might let you
live once my armies came,

216
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:16,346
if only as a slave.

217
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:18,482
I've been a slave for
the last seven years.

218
00:09:18,518 --> 00:09:20,051
I won't do it anymore!

219
00:09:22,012 --> 00:09:24,011
[soft chuckle]

220
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:26,447
I will miss you when you're dead,

221
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,416
but only for a minute.

222
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:29,617
Then you will be forgotten

223
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:33,888
by both time and the world.

224
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:36,424
KELLERMAN: <i>Well, she's
my kid, too, Cindy.</i>

225
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:38,058
I have the weekends and...

226
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:39,393
Well, no, I have the weekends

227
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:41,149
and I don't want a Wednesday afternoon.

228
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:42,351
Why would I want that?

229
00:09:42,354 --> 00:09:45,332
Yeah, nobody does.

230
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:48,269
[soft creaking]

231
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:51,672
Uh-huh.

232
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,808
No, that's okay, Cindy.

233
00:09:58,373 --> 00:10:00,272
[gun cocks]

234
00:10:00,305 --> 00:10:02,817
Mm-hmm.

235
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,084
Yeah, that's fine.

236
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,319
What other days?

237
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,842
What other days do you want?

238
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,810
Actually, you know what?

239
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:16,158
I don't want to discuss this now.

240
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:17,998
No, we'll talk about it later.

241
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,834
Bye.

242
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:24,638
Of all the things

243
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:26,474
that mystify me in this world

244
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,209
since I've been released,

245
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:31,812
is that kale is the rage.

246
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:33,013
Kale.

247
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,382
- [chuckles]
- Theodore Bagwell.

248
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:37,518
Thing that mystifies me equally

249
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,053
is seven years ago,

250
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:40,941
you exonerated Michael,

251
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:42,189
Lincoln, all of them,

252
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,216
except me.

253
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:46,460
[laughs, then grunts]

254
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:48,095
- Really?
- Yes!

255
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:49,230
That's why you're here?

256
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:51,177
Because I didn't exonerate you?

257
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,333
A murderer,

258
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:54,768
a sexual predator a dozen times over.

259
00:10:54,804 --> 00:10:56,170
"Was" is the key word.

260
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:58,780
I'm a man moving toward the light now,

261
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,249
and the light's beckoning me.

262
00:11:00,252 --> 00:11:02,911
I just don't know who's
pulling the strings.

263
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,246
But Sara says it's you.

264
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:07,715
Oh, Sara put you onto me?

265
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,149
Okay.

266
00:11:09,185 --> 00:11:10,985
I don't know who the bigger idiot is,

267
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:12,253
you or her.

268
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:13,730
I was helping her.

269
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:17,992
You were hacking her phone
and sending those people

270
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:19,527
after her... Don't...

271
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:20,929
lie.

272
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:23,430
[sighs]

273
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:25,132
Now...

274
00:11:25,168 --> 00:11:28,068
how about you pour me one of
them nasty little kale jobbies,

275
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,205
and tell me what's all this got
to do with Scofield and myself,

276
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:32,506
who your friends are,

277
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,041
who you are... I want to see

278
00:11:34,077 --> 00:11:36,210
the true face of who's
pulling my strings

279
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:37,879
once and for all.

280
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:41,683
[knocking]

281
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:44,018
You have two visitors in the lobby.

282
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,253
Tell them I'll be right down.

283
00:11:53,263 --> 00:11:55,298
[clears throat]

284
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:57,368
Hey.

285
00:11:57,841 --> 00:11:59,541
I got this, Grace.

[gunfire and shouting in distance]

287
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:13,648
They're in the city.

288
00:12:19,617 --> 00:12:20,616
What are you doing?

289
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:22,855
What do you think I'm doing?

290
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:23,924
Don't run, you dog!

291
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:25,593
Don't run!

292
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:27,895
It is happening. Be ready.

293
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:32,926

[woman screaming]

295
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,714
This pardon better get him out of here.

296
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:38,064
We don't have much time... we
have to get to the warden.

297
00:12:38,942 --> 00:12:40,007
JAMIL: What's going on?

[speaking Arabic]

300
00:12:45,081 --> 00:12:47,481
They're abandoning the
prison. That's why Ibrahim

301
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,816
gave us that pardon.

302
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,136
He knew it was worthless.

303
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:52,453
You and C-Note get the
others to the airport

304
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:54,555
as fast as you can...
There's maybe one flight out.

305
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:55,847
Save two seats.

306
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,291
All right?

307
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:58,659
What are you going to do?

308
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,261
I'm gonna get my brother.

Back up!

312

Back up. Anyone comes at me, dies.

- Understand?
- You think you can shoot all of us?

Huh? You're filth.

Don't lock me in here!

- Well, give me the key.
- I don't have the key.

The guards are gone!

335
00:14:48,594 --> 00:14:50,390
They're abandoning their posts!

336
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:53,393
We're gonna be free!

337
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:56,096
No. We're not free.

338
00:14:56,131 --> 00:14:58,532
Things just got a lot worse.

339

MAN: Push the gate open!

340

Stop! Stop!

341
00:15:01,437 --> 00:15:02,643
What are you doing?

342
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:04,938
- We have to get through the gate!
- If ISIL controls the city,

343
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,474
like they say, it will be
a prison out there as well.

344
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:08,937
We will be persecuted,

345
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,181
as we have been in here, only worse!

346
00:15:11,184 --> 00:15:12,383
At least there's a chance!

347
00:15:12,386 --> 00:15:13,447
You want a chance?

348
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:15,245
Our chance lies in there,

349
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:16,675
in solitary.

350
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:18,233
Our bargaining chip.

351
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:19,686
We get Abu Ramal!

352
00:15:19,722 --> 00:15:21,222
We negotiate passage

353
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,889
out of the country.

354
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:24,458
No, it's madness.

355
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:27,027
Come on. If we work together,
we can push open the gate.

356
00:15:27,062 --> 00:15:28,729
Is that you, Princess?

357
00:15:28,764 --> 00:15:30,998
It is you. We remember this one!

358
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:33,500
- Right? We remember him!
- Please...

359

Friend to Kaniel Outis,

the man who would not
lend my brother a hand!

361

The man who killed my brother,

362
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:42,045
as far as I'm concerned, right?

363
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:44,344
- We are going to go in there and get Abu Ramal!
- No! Please!

364
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:45,979
- No! Please!
- And when we are there,

365
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:50,317
I am personally going to
slice Kaniel Outis' throat.

366
00:15:50,352 --> 00:15:53,353
And you are going to be the one
who's going to help me do it.

367
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:54,888
- No!
- You sent him!

368
00:15:54,923 --> 00:15:56,156
- [men yelling]
- Take him!

369

All of you!

370
00:15:57,726 --> 00:15:59,139
Will you stay here?

371
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,495
And let ISIL slaughter you?

372
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,663
Or will you stand with me?

373
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:04,931
And fight!

[men yelling]

00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:11,304
Doesn't sound very promising!

Ramal,

377
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,071
you want to rethink helping us?

378
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,475
Escape has to start

379
00:16:15,511 --> 00:16:16,308

00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:18,178
All you infidels can go to Hell!

381
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:20,280
We are in Hell, Ramal.

382
00:16:20,315 --> 00:16:22,115
Question is do you want out?

383
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:26,438
- Smash through the door!
- [men clamoring in agreement]

You're so off base on this,

you have no idea.

Y-Yes.

[spits] That is terrible,

00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:37,958

Like a hair shirt?

Torture yourself with kale
to make up for your sins?

406
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:44,764
I don't have any sins anymore, man.

00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,000

- How about the sin of deceit?

Hmm?

A kale-drinking man named
Kellerman by the light of day,

a murderous CIA rogue
named Poseidon at night.

Are you mixed up with Poseidon?

Oh, hell,

I'll tell you about Poseidon.

I mean, he's one of those myths
you hear about in the system.

426
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:25,238
He's an operative so untouchable,

427
00:18:25,274 --> 00:18:27,741
so deep, you couldn't find
him with a nuclear sub.

428
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:29,305
Hence the nickname.

429

439
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:59,680
A spoon a guard overlooked
one time in a thousand.

440
00:19:00,876 --> 00:19:02,317
There's a water pipe above you.

Hook it, pull it down.

442

Do it!

443
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:17,424
Hey. Let me get this straight.
This is getting him out?

444
00:19:17,426 --> 00:19:18,992
MICHAEL: It's getting us all out.

445
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:20,962
This is a two-cell job, mine and his.

446
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:23,129
That's why I couldn't pull it off
when I was in that cell,

447
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:24,598
because the guy across from me,

448
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:26,715
the guy in this cell,
wouldn't cooperate.

- If we surrender,

463

they'll kill us. They only want Ramal.

464

Our best chance of saving
Sid is getting out of here.

Make them forget about
him, start chasing us.

Okay, good.

Now, everybody, back in the block!

There are no prisoners

You realize that, right?

I'm telling you, it's a two-cell job,

that's the point. That side of the wing

is new construction. The pinions

are covered in the hinges...
You can't pull them.

They're open, loose.
